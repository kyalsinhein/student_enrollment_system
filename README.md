# student_enrollment_system
For my BSc Computing final-year project, I implemented a web-based Student Enrollment System to digitize and simplify the enrollment process. The system centralizes student records and documents, streamlines administrative workflows, enhances data security, reduces errors and paperwork, and provides efficient access for both staff and students.
