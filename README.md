# student_enrollment_system
I developed a web-based Student Enrollment System for my BSc Computing final year project, designed to digitize and simplify enrollment. The system centralizes records and documents, streamlines workflows, reduces errors and paperwork, secures student data, and provides efficient access for staff and students.
